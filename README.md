1. What This Script Does
This bash script recursively searches for all Markdown files (.md) within a specified directory and all its subdirectories. It then concatenates the content of these files into a single, new Markdown file. To maintain readability and separation between the original documents, it inserts 7 blank lines after the content of each appended file.

2. Why Use This Script?
This script is particularly useful for:

Consolidating documentation: Combining numerous smaller .md files (e.g., how-to guides, troubleshooting steps, architectural descriptions) into one large, searchable document.

Creating a single source of truth: Generating a comprehensive reference file from a distributed set of Markdown documents.

Preparing content for further processing: Creating a single input file for large language models, search indexes, or other document processing tools.

Offline reference: Having all relevant information in one easy-to-access file.

3. How to Use the Script
Prerequisites
A Unix-like operating system (Linux, macOS, WSL on Windows).

bash shell (most Unix-like systems have this by default).

find and cat utilities (standard on Unix-like systems).

Execution Steps
Navigate to the Root Directory: Open your terminal and change your current directory to the parent folder that contains all the Markdown files and subfolders you wish to consolidate.

Example: If your Markdown files are distributed within /Users/jaime.c/Documents/Unified Tone /cvp-tac and its subdirectories, you would navigate to:

cd "/Users/jaime.c/Documents/Unified Tone /cvp-tac"

(Remember to use quotes if your path contains spaces).

Run the Script: Copy the entire script below and paste it directly into your terminal. Press Enter to execute.

#!/bin/bash

# Define the output file name
OUTPUT_FILE="combined_all_cvp_tac_content.md"

# IMPORTANT: Remove the output file if it already exists to prevent content duplication
echo "Removing existing ${OUTPUT_FILE} to prevent duplication..."
rm -f "${OUTPUT_FILE}"

# Create an empty file to start with
touch "${OUTPUT_FILE}"

echo "Starting recursive consolidation of all .md files from current directory and subdirectories..."

# Use 'find' to get all .md files recursively and safely handle filenames with spaces.
# It then pipes each found file to the 'while' loop.
# -type f: ensures we only process files, not directories.
# -name "*.md": filters for files ending with .md.
# -print0: prints filenames separated by a null character, which is safe for spaces/special characters.
# while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' f; do ...: reads each null-separated filename into variable 'f'.
find . -type f -name "*.md" -print0 | while IFS= read -r -d $'\0' f; do
  # Skip the output file itself if it happens to be found by find (e.g., if it's in the root of the search)
  if [[ "$f" == "./${OUTPUT_FILE}" ]]; then
    continue
  fi

  echo "Appending content from: $f"
  # Append the content of the current markdown file to the output file
  cat "$f" >> "${OUTPUT_FILE}"

  # Add 7 blank lines after each file's content for separation
  for i in $(seq 1 7); do
    echo >> "${OUTPUT_FILE}"
  done
done

echo "Consolidation complete! All content is in ${OUTPUT_FILE}"

4. Output
Upon successful execution, a new file named combined_all_cvp_tac_content.md will be created in the directory where you ran the script. This file will contain the combined content of all .md files found, with 7 blank lines separating the content from each original file.

5. Important Notes
Idempotency: The script first deletes the combined_all_cvp_tac_content.md file if it exists. This ensures that if you run the script multiple times, you always get a fresh consolidation without duplicated content.

File Naming: The output file is hardcoded as combined_all_cvp_tac_content.md. If you need a different name, you must edit the OUTPUT_FILE variable in the script.

Error Handling: The script provides basic messages for its progress. If there are issues with file permissions or other system errors, standard shell error messages will appear.

Image Files: This script only processes .md files. Any image files (e.g., .png, .jpg) in your directories will be ignored.
